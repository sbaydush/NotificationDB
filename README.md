Notification Database


This lets you setup a database that can be queried and written to using Curl commands and also view it as a sortable and searchable table. It uses MariaDB as a database backend and php to execute the queries to the database. This is being created as a way for me to keep track of my homeserver notifications for historical purposes and possibly so I can graph data in the future if need be.
